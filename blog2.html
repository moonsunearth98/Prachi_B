      Medallion Architecture — More Than Just Bronze, Silver & Gold
    </h1>

    <p class="muted mb-4">
      What I actually understood after working with it in real projects.
    </p>

    <div class="line my-4"></div>

    <p>
      The first time I heard about Medallion Architecture, I thought:
      <br><br>
      <strong>“Okay… Bronze, Silver, Gold. Nice names. But what really changes?”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      It sounded simple. Almost too simple.
    </p>

    <p>
      But after building pipelines and debugging production issues, I realized —
      Medallion isn’t about layers.
      It’s about discipline.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4 title">Before Medallion: The Chaos Phase</h5>

    <p>
      In early projects, everything lived together:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Raw source data</li>
      <li>Cleaned data</li>
      <li>Business logic</li>
      <li>Reporting tables</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      And when something went wrong?
    </p>

    <p>
      It felt like searching for a missing key in a messy room.
    </p>

    <p>
      Was the issue in transformation?
      Was it in source?
      Was it in a join?
      Was someone overwriting data?
    </p>

    <p>
      Everything was connected — and that was the problem.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4 title">Then Came Bronze, Silver, Gold</h5>

    <p>
      Suddenly the structure became:
    </p>

    <p><strong>Bronze → Raw and untouched.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Silver → Clean, structured, validated.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Gold → Business-ready, easy to consume.</strong></p>

    <p>
      And something interesting happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Debugging became logical.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>If Gold is wrong → check Silver.</li>
      <li>If Silver is wrong → check Bronze.</li>
      <li>If Bronze is wrong → check source system.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The flow became traceable.
      Problems became easier to isolate.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4 title">What Medallion Actually Gave Me</h5>

    <p>
      Not speed.
      Not magic.
      Not automatic optimization.
    </p>

    <p>
      It gave me:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Clear separation of responsibility</li>
      <li>Safer schema changes</li>
      <li>Better incremental logic handling</li>
      <li>Cleaner audit trails</li>
      <li>Confidence before exposing data to business</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Bronze becomes your safety net.
      Silver becomes your cleaning room.
      Gold becomes your presentation stage.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4 title">But Is It The Only Way?</h5>

    <p>
      I genuinely asked myself this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Are we using Medallion because it’s best?
      Or because it’s popular?
    </p>

    <p>
      The truth?
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s not the only architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can design:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Raw → Curated only</li>
      <li>Staging → Core → Data Mart</li>
      <li>Domain-based data products</li>
      <li>Event-driven structures</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Medallion is not a rulebook.
      It’s a pattern.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4 title">So Why Do I Still Like It?</h5>

    <p>
      Because in real production workloads:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Data changes often.</li>
      <li>Business rules evolve.</li>
      <li>New columns appear.</li>
      <li>Old assumptions break.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Layers protect you.
    </p>

    <p>
      They reduce impact.
      They give you breathing space.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don’t let raw data directly touch dashboards.
      You process it step by step.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4 title">My Personal Definition</h5>

    <p>
      For me, Medallion Architecture means:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Raw → Reliable → Ready.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s less about metals.
      More about maturity.
    </p>

    <div class="line my-4"></div>

    <p class="mb-0">
      In the end, architecture isn’t about copying what others do.
      It’s about choosing what keeps your data stable, clean, and trustworthy.
      <br><br>
      And in my experience, Medallion helps me sleep better when production runs at 2 AM.
